Program to analyse (folded) single pulse data using mostly Fourier techniques.
It is assumed the data contains a single pulse in each subint and that the
baseline is subtracted (use pmod -debase).

pspec [options] inputfile

General Input/Output options:
  -formatlist       Show supported file formats
  -iformat id       Specify input format (e.g.  -iformat PSRFITS)
  -oformat id       Specify output format (e.g. -oformat PSRFITS)
  -headerlist       Show available parameters for the -header option
  -header           Change header parameter, e.g. -header 'name J0123+4567'

General preprocess options:
  -nskip n        Skip n subintegrations in input data (default is 0)
  -nread n        Use n subintegrationss in input data (default is all)
  -rebin n        Rebin to n bins (not necessarily a power of two)
  -conshift       When applying rotations (-rot or -rotdeg), instead of rotating
                  subints independent of each other, rotate the end of one
                  subint to the start of another. One subint will be lost.
  -circshift      idem, but makes the last subint spill over in the first.
                  No subints will be lost.
  -rot ph         Rotate each individual subint by ph pulse phase
  -rotdeg ph      ditto, but in degrees
  -shuffle        Shuffle the subints in a random order

General plotting options:
  -itf n        Set image transfer function for colour map plots
                (0=linear (default), 1=logarithmic, 2=square-root)

General data selection options:
  -onpulse      "left right" manually select on-pulse regions (in bins)
  -onpulsef     "left right" manually select on-pulse regions (in phase)

Other general options:
  -v            Verbose mode (to get a better idea what is happening)
  -debug        Enable more output (where implemented)
  -nocounters   Don't show counters etc (useful when generating log files)
  -libversions  Show version information about libraries used by psrsalsa

General options:
  -nfft               Set size of fft's [default=512].
  -powertwo           When manually selecting onpulse regions, they are forced
                      to be a power of two bins wide.
  -w                  Write out the results to files.
  -bootstrap          Find error bars on the standard deviation, modulation
                      index and subpulse phase by random adding noise to the
                      data. This will be done for the specified number of times
                      (larger value will be more precise, but takes longer). The
                      error bars (although somewhat overestimated) are more
                      accurate than the analytic approximation used by default.

Output options:
  -prof               Compute pulse profile.
  -lrfs               Compute LRFS.
  -DC                 Leave the DC channel in the LRFS.
  -stddev             Compute standard deviation profile.
  -stddev_sigma       Specify sigma threshold for the stddev output to file.
                      The plot (shown with -prof) only shows 3 sigma detections.
  -mod                Compute modulation index profile.
  -mod_sigma          Specify sigma threshold for the mod. index output to file.
                      The plot (shown with -prof) only shows 3 sigma detections.
  -track              Compute subpulse phase track (use with -freq).
  -track_dphase       Add specified offset (in deg) to the subpulse phase track.
  -track_firstregion  Only use the first selected onpulse region to find the
                      alignments of the phases of the different fft blocks.
                      The other onpulse regions are still used to subtract from
                      the LRFS from which the phases are derived.
  -slope              Subtract slope from subpulse phases (in degrees subpulse
                      phase per degree pulse longitude).
  -amplitude          Compute modulation amplitude (use with -freq).
  -2dfs               Compute 2DFS.
  -s2dfs_p3           Compute S2DFS (sliding 2DFS P3 map).
  -s2dfs_p2           Compute S2DFS (sliding 2DFS P2 map)
                      (for first selected region only).
  -freq               Define which fluctuation frequencies (in cpp) are used for
                      the subpulse phase track/amplitude calculation
  -p3fold             "P3 n": Fold the data using this P3 value in pulse
                      periods and the P3 cycle is divided in n bins in the final
                      result. If n > P3, the different bins are not independent
                      and you might want to use -p3fold_smooth option to make
                      the effective resolution equal to P3.
  -p3fold_dphase      Add this subpulse phase in degrees (can also use -slope).
  -p3fold_norefine    Do not attemt to align subsequent blocks, i.e. fixed
                      period folding
  -p3fold_nritt       Set the number of itterations, which produces a template
                      first thereby producing better results. Default is 1.
  -p3fold_cpb         Set the number of cycles per block used in the cross
                      correlation used to compensate for P3 variations. More
                      means more signal to correlate (more precise alignment of
                      the blocks, less means less smearing in each block because
                      of P3 variation within the block. Default is 1.
  -p3fold_smooth      Replace the tophat weight used to assign power to the P3
                      bins with a Gausian weight with this width in pulse
                      periods. This could make oversampling look nicer and
                      reduce the effective resolution. Example: if P3=10P, you
                      could set n in the -p3fold option to 20, resulting in
                      oversampling with a factor 2. By setting -p3fold_smooth
                      to 2, the effective resolution is reduced by a factor 2
                      because each input pulse is smeared out with this width
                      in pulse periods.
  -p3fold_noonpulse   Ignore selected pulse longitude range, but use the full
                      range when doing the cross correlations
  -p2zap              "P2min P2max" Zap fluctuations in this P2 range in cpp.
  -p3zap              "P3min P3max" Zap fluctuations in this P3 range.
                      P3min and P3max can be specified as bins or in cpp.
